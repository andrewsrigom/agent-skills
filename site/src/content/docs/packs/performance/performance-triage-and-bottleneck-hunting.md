Use this skill when the real problem is finding the bottleneck, not prematurely applying optimizations.

## Scope

- slow pages, routes, interactions, and API endpoints
- unclear ownership between network, server, database, render, and bundle cost
- deciding whether performance work belongs to Next.js, React, Node.js, or infrastructure
- turning vague “this feels slow” reports into measurable bottlenecks

## Routing cues

- slow route, slow page load, high TTFB, bad interaction latency, render lag, hydration cost, p95 regression, or “where is the bottleneck” -> use this skill
- once the dominant cost is clearly React rerenders or state blast radius -> use `react-render-performance-and-state-boundaries`
- once the dominant cost is clearly Next.js route rendering, bundle, or client boundary cost -> use `nextjs-performance-and-render-cost`
- once the dominant cost is clearly API latency or server throughput -> use `nodejs-api-latency-and-throughput`
- once the bottleneck is already known and the task is measurement discipline -> use `profiling-before-optimizing`

## Default path

1. Restate the user-visible symptom in one sentence.
2. Choose one primary metric that represents the pain:
   - route TTFB
   - interaction latency
   - slow API duration
   - render or hydration time
   - memory growth or CPU saturation
3. Identify the likely owning layer before editing code:
   - network and third-party
   - server and database
   - React render tree
   - client bundle and hydration
4. Measure one representative path end to end.
5. Name the dominant bottleneck and only then route to the narrower optimization skill.

## When to deviate

- Use synthetic benchmarks only when the real user path is unavailable or too noisy.
- Start with production telemetry when it already exists and the local reproduction is misleading.
- Split into multiple bottlenecks only when one path truly has more than one dominant cost center.

## Guardrails

- Do not optimize before naming the metric and owning layer.
- Do not change several layers at once just because the app feels slow.
- Prefer the largest visible bottleneck over many tiny improvements.
- Keep user-facing latency separate from internal throughput or CPU efficiency.

## Avoid

- “performance pass” edits without a bottleneck hypothesis
- mixing database, render, and bundle work in one optimization step
- treating p50 improvement as success when p95 is the real problem
- guessing the bottleneck from code style instead of measurement

## Verification checklist

- the user-visible symptom is explicit
- one primary metric is chosen
- the likely owning layer is named
- a dominant bottleneck is identified before optimization starts
- the response routes to a narrower skill if triage is complete

## Output Shape

When answering with this skill, prefer:

- symptom
- primary metric
- likely owning layer
- dominant bottleneck hypothesis
- next measurement or next specialized skill
