title: "Node.js API Latency And Throughput"
description: "Use when a Node.js API is slow because of per-request work, bad concurrency shape, I/O amplification, or weak throughput defaults. Covers p95-first analysis, request path simplification, batching, cancellation, and avoiding fake optimizations that hurt operability."

Use this skill when the problem is API performance under real request load, not generic runtime style.

## Scope

- endpoint latency
- throughput under concurrency
- repeated per-request setup
- I/O amplification
- expensive serialization or CPU work in hot paths

## Default path

1. Pick the slow endpoint or request class.
2. Measure p50 and p95 before changing code.
3. Remove repeated per-request setup first:
   - config parsing
   - client construction
   - redundant auth or schema work
4. Batch or collapse avoidable I/O.
5. Keep concurrency bounded and intentional.
6. Move CPU-heavy work off the hot request path only when measurement shows it dominates.

## When to deviate

- Favor p95 and p99 over throughput if the business pain is tail latency.
- Trade some peak throughput for safer memory or better cancellation when the API is interactive.
- Stream responses only when it reduces real wait time or memory pressure.

## Guardrails

- Tail latency usually matters more than one fast happy-path benchmark.
- Reusing clients and connections is often higher leverage than clever code changes.
- `Promise.all` is not a free win when it creates downstream pressure or burst load.
- Keep request cancellation and timeouts in the design when external I/O is involved.

## Avoid

- building clients or pools inside the request handler
- unbounded concurrency in a hot path
- optimizing CPU when network or database dominates
- reporting throughput gains while hiding worse tail latency or memory spikes

## Verification checklist

- endpoint and percentile metric are explicit
- per-request setup was audited
- concurrency shape is intentional
- the dominant I/O or CPU bottleneck is named
- p95 or user-visible latency improved, not just synthetic throughput
